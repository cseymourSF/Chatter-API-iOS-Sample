This is a sample app showing you how to use the Chatter REST API in conjunction with RestKit to make a simple feed explorer.

There is another sample app at https://github.com/cseymourSF/Chatter-API-iOS-PhotoPoster showing how to post a new photo post to a group.

You MUST set the "PPConsumerKey" value in the info plist to the correct Consumer Key for your application! This value comes from the Remote Access App setup on Salesforce.

The code in Classes/RestKit is the RestKit submodule: https://github.com/twotoasters/RestKit
